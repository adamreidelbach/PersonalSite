                <p class="indent bio-text1">My introduction to programming started out maintaining the website for my high school’s marching band. I learned the basics of HTML/CSS by viewing the source on websites that I enjoyed and tried to recreate them myself. I continued to build websites over the next few years for various bands I played in as a kid, and just for fun! After over ten years of playing and teaching drums, I wanted to start to build a career that would allow me to be home more frequently and grow in a new way. I started to think about what things excited me outside of playing drums, and programming jump out very quickly.
                <p class="indent bio-text2">I love the ability to create something that others can use and enjoy. As a drummer (in certain musical situations), you're not always making something new; sometimes you just have to learn the part someone else composed. However, in programming, it feels great to create something new almost every single day. I can express my creativity in new ways I’ve often felt like I was missing out on. It’s exciting to share what I’ve created with others and see how they react. It’s a unique experience and something I am excited to continue to build upon.</p>
